# NoActivityStarter

== INFORMATION AND CHANGED  ==

This project has gone through many changes during it's development, and my expectations changed a lot from when I first planned it. As I had first planned to make an application that would schedule and work as a secondary calendar app, it became a calendar reader. I was not able to get any notifications to work, but I was able to use intents to allow the user to add individual events to their personal calendar. 

** NOTE ABOUT FIRESTORE ** 
 Because I cannot troubleshoot with the administration google-services.json file, I have added the testing google-services.json within the application under google-services-TEST.json, so it can be used if renamed to show how it can function with that setup.
